          <h1>Skills</h1>
          <p>My coding journey began with the foundational elements of web development—HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python through exploration and self-learning which layed the groundwork for my transition into software development. <br><br>
            Completing the Just IT Software Development Bootcamp was an enriching experience that provided me with a comprehensive understanding of key technologies and methodologies essential for launching a successful career in software development. The program, aligned with Level 3 qualification standards, offered practical hands-on experience in industry-standard programming languages and essential concepts, including:
            HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Database Design, Python. <br><br>
            In addition to these core components, I further upskilled in:
            Database Management: MySQL and Python's SQLite, Web Frameworks: Deployment with Flask, Version Control: Git and GitHub. <br><br>
            This immersive experience not only expanded my technical knowledge but also equipped me with practical, hands-on skills essential for real-world projects. <br><br>
            Dedicated to continuous learning, I stay updated with the latest trends and technologies through platforms like Codecademy and industry podcasts. Additionally, I follow influential figures in the software development community on YouTube and Instagram, enriching my knowledge and staying inspired by their insights and expertise. <br><br>
            Fun Fact: During the Consolidation week of the bootcamp, I inadvertently deleted all my project files while working with Git. It was a challenging moment that required working around the clock to recover the projects. However, I successfully overcame the setback and emerged with valuable lessons in resilience and problem-solving. 🔥

                <p>FilmFlix is a Flask web application for managing a film database. It allows users to browse, add, update, and delete film records with ease. <br> Challenging, complex, I love the wholeness of this project. For styling I used the front-end framework Bootstrap.</p>

                <h2>FilmFlix Project</h2>
                <p>Developed a command-line Python application for FilmFlix, enabling management of their film database with CRUD operations. Utilized SQLite3 SQL database for seamless integration. Features include printing all records, adding, updating, and deleting film entries, and generating various reports based on genre, year, and rating. Streamlined user experience with intuitive menu options for easy navigation. <br> I enjoyed working on this Python app with SQLite database. I am proud I achieve to embed the Search menu in the main.</p>
