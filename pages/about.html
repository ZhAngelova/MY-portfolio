            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>I am Zhasmina, a determined individual transitioning from a successful career in hospitality management to the dynamic field of software development. With a strong foundation in teamwork, effective communication, and attention to detail cultivated during my tenure in hospitality, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the world of technology. <br>
                <br>Driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to personal and professional growth, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and skill acquisition. Through independent study and participation in a rigorous 12 weeks software development bootcamp, I acquired proficiency in a range of front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, and database design. <br>
                <br>My dedication to excellence extends beyond technical proficiency. I am known for my proactive approach to problem-solving, ability to thrive in dynamic environments, and dedication to fostering collaborative relationships. I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and embark on a fulfilling professional journey as a Junior Software Developer, contributing to innovative projects and driving positive change in the technology landscape. <br>
